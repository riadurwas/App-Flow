Title: End-to-End CI/CD Pipeline Implementation with Jenkins and DevOps Tools

Project Overview

This project demonstrates the setup of a complete CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins and multiple DevOps tools to automate building, testing, deployment, and monitoring.
It shows how software moves from code to production with full automation, ensuring quality, speed, and reliability.

The pipeline includes version control, build automation, code analysis, artifact storage, deployment to servers, monitoring, and notifications — all integrated into one flow.
